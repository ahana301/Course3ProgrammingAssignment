# Course3ProgrammingAssignment
First the packages requires for the programming are installed.
Then the text files containing the data are read.
Next the training and the test sets are merged to create one data set.
After that only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted.
Descriptive activity names are used to name the activities in the data set
The data set isAppropriately labelled with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4,second, independent tidy data set is crestednwith the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
